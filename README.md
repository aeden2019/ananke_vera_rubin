# ananke_vera_rubin

This jupyter notebook acquires FIRE simulation data from the local machine.
The FIRE data is passed through the py-ananke process to produce a synthetic survey. 
The data in the synthetic survey is then broken down and analysed. 

Running the FIRE simulation data requires gizmo_analysis library: 
https://bitbucket.org/awetzel/gizmo_analysis/src/master/

The ananke library can be found here:

vera_rubin_anankethon is a simplified version of the code that is used as a sample case for the 2023 anankethon
